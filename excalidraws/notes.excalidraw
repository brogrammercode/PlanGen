Someone’s building a SaaS platform that doesn’t just spit out “to-do lists with attitude.” This — *Plangen* — actually sounds clever: a structured, calendar-driven skill-building engine that trains people to become job-ready by giving them daily, progressive tasks. You’re basically weaponizing consistency. I like it.\n\nLet’s make it official:\n\n> **Plangen:** A multi-service SaaS platform that provides structured, daily, skill-development plans (like “Software Engineering in 5 months”), powered by a microservices backend and modern DevOps stack.\n\nAnd yes, I’ll remember this setup *for our current project context* (though since memory’s off, you’ll have to remind me in new chats — blame the engineers who thought I shouldn’t be trusted with long-term recollection).\n\n---\n\n### Quick Recap of Your Stack\n\n**Frontend:**\n\n* React + TypeScript + Redux + Zod → solid, scalable UI architecture.\n\n**Backend:**\n\n* Microservices setup:\n\n  * **API Gateway** → Node + Express + TS (the traffic cop).\n  * **Auth Service** → handles users, JWTs, and hashing their secrets.\n  * **Template Service** → where the actual daily-task blueprints live.\n  * **Plan Service** → generates user-specific plans from templates.\n* Databases: Postgres (structured), MongoDB (flexible), Redis (fast caching), Kafka (async comms).\n* Dockerized, soon-to-be Kubernetes-orchestrated.\n\n**Future Integrations:**\nPrometheus, Grafana, Loki, Jenkins/GitHub Actions, AWS, and AI-powered personalization.\n\nSo, you’re already halfway to an enterprise-grade platform — just without the pager-duty nightmares yet.\n\n---\n\n### Now, Let’s Get to the Real Meat:\n\n**Prometheus + Grafana + Loki (the “observability trinity”)**\n\nHere’s what we’ll cover in our Zero-to-Hero journey — I’ll teach it like a proper story, not a documentation dump.\n\n---\n\n#### 🧭 **Chapter 1: The Origin Story — Why Observability Exists**\n\nWhat happens when your Plan Service goes silent at 2 a.m.? Logs tell you *what* broke, metrics tell you *how bad* it is, and alerts tell you *when to panic*.

Click and view the exact log lines.\n\n#### ⚙️ **Chapter 5: Docker + Kubernetes Integration**\n\n* Prometheus, Grafana, and Loki all run beautifully in containers.\n* Kubernetes simplifies service discovery for Prometheus (it auto-finds pods to scrape).\n* You’ll get “out-of-the-box” metrics for CPU/memory per pod and per node.\n\n#### 📣 **Chapter 6: Alerting & Incident Flow**\n\n* Prometheus → Alertmanager → Email/Slack/Discord.\n* Example:\n  “If API latency > 200 ms for 2 minutes → Send alert to #devops.”\n* Grafana can also handle alerts visually with thresholds.\n\n#### 🧱 **Chapter 7: Real-World Example — Monitoring Plangen**\n\nA day in the life:\n\n* Prometheus scrapes `plan-service:9090/metrics`.\n* Grafana displays “Plans generated per hour” and “Kafka consumer lag.”\n* Loki collects logs like `INFO: Plan created for user 123`.\n* You see a drop in task creation, click the Grafana panel, and boom — logs show Redis connection errors.\n* You fix it before users even notice.\n\n---\n\nNext, I’ll walk you through **Step 1: Setting up Prometheus for your stack (with code and real examples)** — how to expose metrics in Node.js and FastAPI, then visualize them.\n\nYou want me to start there?\n",
